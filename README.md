Community-driven, transparent watchlist of suspicious Hive accounts & DMCA URLs; a reference for scam, AML, and DMCA monitoring

---

## Overview

Watchmen is a simple repository for collecting and sharing lists of Hive accounts (and specific post URLs) that have been flagged for potential fraud, money laundering, or copyright issues. Contributors can add raw input files, which will later be processed and published in various formats.

Use our community-run gitlab instance to contribute: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/watchmen

### Important Note on Forked Networks

Accounts on Steem 💩™, or any other fork are **not** covered by this watchlist. Always assume non-Hive–native accounts are untrustworthy.
